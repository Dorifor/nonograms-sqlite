# Nono archive to Sqlite

I always wanted to try out sqlite, now I have an opportunity to use it for something cool !

## Usage
1. Get / Generate an archive from the [nonograms-archive](https://github.com/Dorifor/nonograms-archive) repo
2. ???
3. Profit

## Warnings
I used a [fairly new](https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/array.html#array.array.clear) method from Python 3.13, it may break down if you have an earlier version.
